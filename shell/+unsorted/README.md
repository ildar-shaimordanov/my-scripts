# `./cap`

*cap* and *tee* are plumbing fitting. If the last one is used to change
direction of pipes, the first one is used to stop flows and seal end
of a pipe.

Here *cap* is used to stop flowing long lines out of a terminal
width. In the other words, everything wider will be cropped by the
terminal width.

# `./ctrace.bash`

Print the full stack of execution contexts

# `./def.sh`

Description

POSIX-compatible way to define a shell function called `name` with
the ability to display the function declaration which is stored in
the `$DEF_name` variable.

Usage

Use any character sequence except a single quote character for the
heredoc identifier (`DEF` in the example). The mandatory condition
for the right function definition is disabling the variable and
command substitution in the funtion body. It is achieved by quoting
the identifier within the single quotes as it's shown in the example.

    def name <<'DEF'
    ...
    DEF

The idea was borrowed from this answer and modified for prettier usage:

    defn() { code=$(cat) ; eval "${1}_code=\$code; $1() { $code; }" ; }

# `./diff-color.sh`

Compare two files and and colorize the output

Example:

    cdiff DIR1 DIR2
    vdiff DIR1 DIR2

# `./diff-ls`

Compare two sorted directories

Example:

    diff-ls DIR1 DIR2

# `./dmesg-T.sh`

# `./prefixtrude.sh`

Extract the common leading substring from the input strings

Example: print "qwe"

    printf '%s\n' qwerty qweasd | prefixtrude

# `./rep.sh`

Repeat the given string the particular number of times

* `$1` - string
* `$2` - number or repetition

There are three implementations:

* bash only, full of bashisms
* POSIX-compliant
* POSIX-compliant, safe and awful

Example: print 10 "#"

    rep "#" 10

# `./sponge`

slurp a stuff and burp...

    ... | sponge [-a] file

# `./teem`

*teem* means *rain heavily*. Here *teem* stands for *tee modified*,
implying that action of the standard `tee` tool is modified, and keeps
also connection with the meaning of the word, that's every new running
leads to teeming with new file.


    Usage: ... | teem [OPTIONS] [LABEL]
    Copy standard input to a file named 'LABEL-YYYY-mm-dd-HH-MM-SS.log'.
    If no LABEL is specified, defaults to 'tee'.
    
    Options
    	-i	Ignore an interrupt signal
    	-h	Print this help and exit
    

# `./timer.sh`

Report time consumed by command execution.

Example:

```shell
timer watch sleep 10
```

# `./tmuxa.sh`

Create a new session named as "$1" if it doesn't exist and attach to it.
Additional options and commands are applicable.

Any other clients attached to this session will be detached, if the
`TMUX_DETACH` variable is set to any non-empty value.

Example: run the session "my_work"

    tmuxa my_work

# `./transpose`

Transpose a table

    $ printf '%s %s\n' 1 2 3 4 5 6 | ./transpose
    1 3 5
    2 4 6

# `./trap_debug.bash`

Debugging in bash

Example:

```shell
set -T # debug functions as well
trap trap_debug DEBUG
```

How to use it without function

```shell
trap 'printf "# $LINENO: $BASH_COMMAND" >&2' DEBUG
trap 'printf "# $LINENO: $BASH_COMMAND" >&2 ; read' DEBUG
```

Based on the idea published here:

# `./trap_debug_print.bash`

Control output of debugging information

A colon separated lists of patterns used to decide which command lines
should be shrinked until the length of the matched pattern or skipped
completely while output. Each pattern is anchored to the beginning
of the command line and assumed implicitly is followed by the space
character.

Variables

* `$TRAP_IGNORE`
* `$TRAP_SHRINK`

These variables can be useful to prevent duplicates of those commands
which usually echoing long texts. The predefined command are `echo`,
`printf`, `cat -` `cat  `. The two last patterns match to the command
usually used to output long texts in heredoc.

Functions

* `trap_debug_print`

This function can be used at the beginning of the script or somewhere
else to initialize DEBUG trap. It analyzes the $BASH_COMMAND variable,
compares the invoked command with the patterns in the $TRAP_SHRINK
and $TRAP_IGNORE and makes decision how to output the current shell
command (shrink it or skip completely). Other commands mismatching to
those patterns will be outputted after the `+` character. at the very
beginning of the printed string.

# `./try.sh`

Execute any command silently.

Example:

    try sleep 10

# `./tty_size.sh`

Print a terminal size in columns or lines.

Don't rely on the variables `COLUMNS` and `LINES` because POSIX or
minimalistic shells like dash don't update them automatically every
time a terminal is resized.

More details about these variables are given in this page:

# `./unhtml.sh`

Remove all styles, scripts and html comments totally, strip html tags
and leave a naked text only.

# `./x11sudo.sh`

Enable X11 settings of the current user when `sudo`-ing to another one.
