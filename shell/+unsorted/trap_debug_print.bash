# Control output of debugging information
#
# A colon separated lists of patterns used to decide which command lines
# should be shrinked until the length of the matched pattern or skipped
# completely while output. Each pattern is anchored to the beginning
# of the command line and assumed implicitly is followed by the space
# character.
#
# Variables
#
# * `$TRAP_IGNORE`
# * `$TRAP_SHRINK`
#
# These variables can be useful to prevent duplicates of those commands
# which usually echoing long texts. The predefined command are `echo`,
# `printf`, `cat -` `cat  `. The two last patterns match to the command
# usually used to output long texts in heredoc.
#
# Functions
#
# * `trap_debug_print`
#
# This function can be used at the beginning of the script or somewhere
# else to initialize DEBUG trap. It analyzes the $BASH_COMMAND variable,
# compares the invoked command with the patterns in the $TRAP_SHRINK
# and $TRAP_IGNORE and makes decision how to output the current shell
# command (shrink it or skip completely). Other commands mismatching to
# those patterns will be outputted after the `+` character. at the very
# beginning of the printed string.
