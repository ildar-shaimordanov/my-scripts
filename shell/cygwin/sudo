# Being Administrators, invoke the command directly
id -G | grep -qw 544 && {
	"$@"
	exit $?
}

# The CYG_SUDO variable is used to control the command invocation
[ -z "$CYG_SUDO" ] && {
	mintty="$( which mintty 2>/dev/null )"
	export CYG_SUDO="$$"
	cygstart --wait --action=runas $mintty /bin/bash "$0" "$@"
	exit $?
}

# Now we are able to:
# -- launch the command
# -- display the message
# -- return the exit code
